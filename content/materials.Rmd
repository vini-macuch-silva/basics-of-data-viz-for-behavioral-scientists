# Course materials

The primary source for this course consists of a browser-readable book, which is used as a teaching aid in class but can also serve as a self-standing tutorial. The book can be found [here](https://vini-macuch-silva.github.io/basics-of-data-viz-for-behavioral-scientists/R-Markdown-book/docs/basics-of-data-wrangling-in-r.html).

The two papers the data sets used in the course refer to are:
