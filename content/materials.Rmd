# Course materials

The primary source for this course consists of a browser-readable code book, which is used as a teaching aid in class but can also serve as a self-standing tutorial. The book can be found [here](https://github.com/vini-macuch-silva/basics-of-data-viz-for-behavioral-scientists/tree/master/docs/R-Markdown-book/).
