# Course assessment

Students will be assessed on the basis of the following components:

- [**10%**] Presence and class participation;

- [**40%**] Completion of a homework task between week 1 and week 2. The homework will consist of exploring the rating data and producing a visual report of the most interesting/ salient data patterns;

- [**50%**] Completion of a final assignment consisting of drafting a "results" section of a scientific paper, including producing publication-ready visulizations of both the rating data and the reaction time data.
