# Basics of data visualization for behavioral scientists

<br>

<p align="justify">This course is aimed at students who have little or no experience analyzing behavioral data from laboratory experiments or surveys and questionnaires. The focus of the course lies in introducing students to the basics of data exploration and visualization in the programming language R, relying on data sets from two psycholinguistic studies on non-literal language. The course will consist of hands-on coding sessions, with guided live demonstrations and both in-class and home exercises. Students are expected to obtain practical knowledge of data exploration and visualization for the purposes of behavioral research. By the end of the course, they should be able to produce basic visual reports of rating data and reaction time data.</p>
