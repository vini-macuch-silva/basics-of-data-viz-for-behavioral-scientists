      <description>Course assessmentStudents will be assessed on the basis of the following components:
[10%] Presence and class participation;
[40%] Completion of a homework assignment between week 1 and week 2. The homework will consist of exploring the rating data and producing a visual report of the most interesting/ relevant data patterns;
[50%] Completion of a final assignment consisting of drafting a “results” section of a scientific paper which includes publication-ready visualizations of both the rating data and the reaction time data.</description>
