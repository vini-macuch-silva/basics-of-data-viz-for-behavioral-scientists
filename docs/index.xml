      <description>Course assessmentStudents will be assessed on the basis of the following components:
[10%] Presence and class participation;
[40%] Completion of a homework assignment between week 1 and week 2. The homework will consist of exploring rating data from a provided data set and producing a basic visual report of the data;
[50%] Completion of a final assignment consisting of drafting a tentative “results” section of a scientific paper built around publication-ready visualizations of both rating data and reaction time data from a provided data set.</description>
